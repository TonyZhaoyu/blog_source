RISC ISA has been dominating the embedded world over decades. ARM, specifically, accounts for a huge market share, and leaves much limited space for MIPS. As AI and ML becomes pervasive recently, fabricating domain-specific SoCs leads a new trend in IC industry that was used to be ruled by a few giants. People tend to value ISA more since ISA constitutes the corner-stone of a general-purpose CPU in such SoCs. An ISA  which is free from license, ease to customize with a complete tool-chain would be in much favor of architects from various domains. By far, RISC-V might arguably be the chosen one due to its open-source character, and activated community. Thanks to the emergence of RISC-V, we finally see some challenge to a closed-source ARM.

Moreover, the spirit of open-source has stimulated multiple organizations to embrace the new era of SoC designs, including some big names (like *Silicon Labs* and *NXP*) from IC industry. Really exited to foresee open RISC dominates the market in 5 to 10 years.
