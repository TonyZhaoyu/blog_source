Here is a wish list for 2019. I have done some tailor work, and the following should present a resonable one.

1. C-code improvement.
2. 

1. Improve C programming by the following methods:

 * Read Linux Kernel source code. Focus on:

   a. Device driver development.
   b. Data structure implementation.
   c. Objective-oriented techniques.
   d. Tricks in C language and compiler extensions.

 * Read Z-Wave Z/IP gateway and middleware source code. Focus on:
   Link: https://github.com/Z-WavePublic/libzwaveip

   a. Linux application programming interfaces.
   b. IP technologies (IPv6 mapping and IPv4 tunneling).
   c. Crypto technologies.

 * Read BT-Mesh stack source code and focus on:

   a. Compiler extension for embedded use case.
   b. Data structure and management.

 * Read FreeRTOS source code and focus on:

   a. Implementations of resources like message queue, mutex etc.
   b. Implementations of TCP/UDP stack.
   c. Implementations of OS scheduling.
   d. Implementations of file systems.

 * To measure the outcome, running test code and write blogs.

2. Improve BT-Mesh (Z-Wave models) understanding.

 * Carefully read BT-Mesh protocol specifications (if necessary, Bluetooth spec).
 * Be familiar with BT-Mesh model specifications.
 * (Optional) Be familiar with Z-Wave model specifications.

3. Improve data structure / algorithm.

 * Practice code challenges on Leetcode. Focus on:

   a. Primary and medium level.
   b. Relations to Linux implementation.

 * To measure the outcome, use interview questions for testing. Write blogs.

4. Improve knowledge about Verilog and RISC-V.

 * Be familiar with multiple comm protocols, e.g., SPI, I2C, UART, PCIe. Plan to implement them in Verilog, validate them on Ubuntu, and synthesis them on a FPGA.
 * Read RISC-V books and specs to learn the ISA. Try to implement an embedded CPU on a FPGA.
 * (Optional) Write code for MCU controlling different buses.
 * (Optional) Design Linux drivers for different busses.
 * Write blogs.

5. Book to be finished by the end of year 2019.

 * Computer systems: a programmerâ€™s perspective (Chinese edition).
 * Head first design pattern.
 * Computer architecture: a quantitative approach.
 * The measurement is to write blogs about understanding and answer questions after each chapter.

6. Other books will work as reference books as the project goes on.
